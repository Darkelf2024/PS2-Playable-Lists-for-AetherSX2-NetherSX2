# 🎮 PS2 Playable Lists for AetherSX2 & NetherSX2

> Curated, tested PlayStation 2 compatibility lists focused on **real playability**, not just booting.

This repository contains **three structured PS2 game lists** for **AetherSX2** and **NetherSX2**, designed to help users quickly determine:
- Which games run well
- Whether tweaks are required
- Which emulator behaves best for a given title

---

## 📌 Why This Repository Exists

Most compatibility lists are either:
- Outdated
- Boot-only
- Lacking real gameplay testing
- Or unclear about required settings

This project focuses on:
- ✅ **Playable results**
- ⚙️ **Clear default vs tweaked separation**
- 🧪 **Real playtime validation**
- 📱 **Android-focused emulator behavior**

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

- **Defaults first**  
  Most playable PS2 games should work using safe, default emulator settings.

- **Tweaks only when needed**  
  Tweaks are documented only when they provide meaningful improvements.

- **NetherSX2 awareness**  
  NetherSX2 behaves differently from AetherSX2 in some cases — those differences matter.

- **Tested, not theoretical**  
  Entries are based on real gameplay sessions, not boot screens.
